An Android app made for a Mobile Application Development class at NSCC. This app is just a basic calculator with support for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. This app successfully handles things like division by zero and prevents the user from crashing it if they use multiple operators in a row. The only multiple operators in a row allowed a at most two subtraction signs, for subtracting negatives. Buttons that aren't appropriate to be pressed in the moment are disabled to further prevent errors.
